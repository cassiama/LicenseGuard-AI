# LicenseGuard (Agent)

LicenseGuard is designed to help you easily understand the software licenses of your project's dependencies.

Here's what it offers:

- **Effortless License Checking**: Simply provide your project's `requirements.txt`, and LicenseGuard will analyze it for you.
- **Clear License Identification**: The system identifies the software licenses associated with your dependencies.
- **Understandable Reports**: Get a straightforward JSON report detailing the licenses found, along with a confidence score.
- **Simple Integration**: You can interact with LicenseGuard through a user-friendly API to submit your dependency list and retrieve the analysis results.

LicenseGuard simplifies the process of checking software licenses, giving you a quick and clear picture of your project's licensing landscape.

The purpose of this repository to provide AI-powered insights for the [frontend](https://github.com/cassiama/LicenseGuard-UI) when the user provides their analysis result from the backend REST API.

There are two parts:
- the internal AI agent that's responsible for generating a risk report when provided a JSON analysis result
- the front-facing REST API that streams the risk report generated by the internal AI agent

## Quickstart

The fastest and easiest way to get this running on your machine is to use Docker.

### Requirements

In short:

- have Docker Desktop/Engine installed on your local machine
- have an OpenAI API key
- environment variables for connecting to the MCP server's URL

---

Make sure you have Docker Desktop (or Docker Engine) installed on your machine. If you don't, download it from [Docker's website](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/).

#### Environment Variables

You will need to provide the following, otherwise you will see errors as you try to use this service:

- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: fairly self-explanatory (if you don't have one, you can get one on the [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)). Your key should look like this: `sk-proj-<random characters>-<random characters>`
- `MCP_SERVER_HOST`: refers to the host that your MCP server is running on. Your host should be a HTTP/HTTPS domain (e.g. `http://localhost`)
- `MCP_SERVER_PORT`: refers to the port that your MCP server is running on. Your port should be a number from 0 to 65535 (16-bit number) that **doesn't** conflict with a port already in use on the computer. But you should probably just choose `8000` since that's the default port number for the MCP server.

Optionally, for the sake of reproducibility, you can also provide the following environment variables. They provide [LangSmith tracing](https://smith.langchain.com/) so you can view the logs of the agent:
- `LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2`: a boolean (either `true` or `false`). You  It should look like this: `true`
- `LANGCHAIN_ENDPOINT`: a remote URL that you can access for LangSmith API calls; typically the official LangSmith API URL. It should look like this: `https://api.smith.langchain.com`
- `LANGCHAIN_API_KEY`: a stirng corresponding to the LangSmith API key (provided by LangChain/LangSmith).
- `LANGCHAIN_PROJECT`: a string corresponding to the name of the project. However, if not provided, the project name will be `default`. It should look like this: `LicenseGuard-AI`
